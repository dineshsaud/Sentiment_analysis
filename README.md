# sentiment_analysis
The main idea behind doing this project was to learn concepts in NLP. Concept such as different vectorization technique and Algorithm.
I had used kaggle kernel to complete the project. 
After compeleting the project i saved the model and then implented the project in Flask. 
Detail documentation of the project is given on jupyter notebook itself. I am also planning to document the things i have learned in this project.
